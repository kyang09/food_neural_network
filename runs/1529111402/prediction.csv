"this is an amazing gem in the back of a true polish grocery in the strip district pierogis we 're amazing , featuring three flavors and a rotating daily special on this day the sweet cheese pierogi was amazingly faintly sweet and complimented the dough perfectly overall easily in the top tier of pierogis in town the nalesniki was pristinely prepared and also not too sweet order at the counter and prices still affordable , hard to say anything negative of this place",1.0

"i'm from nyc and still these bagels are high on my list ! the sesame bagel is mass produced here for good reason if you go before noon , the sesame bagels are freshly made constantly , so you can get one and eat it fresh and hot out of the oven i personally like the everything bagel the most and think that if you can bring it home to toast it would be just as good if not better than the sesame one what makes these bagels special is that they 're covered with toppings all over , not just on one side",1.0

"this place was nice from the very warm customer service to the taste of their items it 's hard to see off the road a bit , but worth trying my family usually goes to a local store to pick up donuts and i have to say , we wo n't be going back to the other stores when we get in our donut fix anymore there is a list of smoothies on the wall which are great ! my kids loved the ham and cheese croissant ! they were light and fluffy and tasted great ! the glazed donuts reminded me of a fresh warm krispy kreme donut , but not as sweet they were well balanced and very fresh compared to the other places we 've tried in the area , this trumps them they do n't have a huge selection of donuts , but the taste and quality more than make up for it if you can stop by and try them out , the price is reasonable and will be worth the trip you 'll be glad you did it !",1.0

"i would echo what many other reviewers have said great beer selection , staff could be a tad more on the ball \( although one night we sat at the bar and had a very nice and chatty bartender \) food is hit and miss , but the hits are pretty great the bison burger is amazing there is so much flavour in the patty itself , it is n't just a vessel for toppings because of bison 's leanness you should ask for it a little rarer another great choice that seems to be often overlooked is the shepherd 's pie the pulled pork sandwich should be avoided due to a very strange celery heavy sauce choice pricing for food and beer is quite reasonable considering the quality mixed drinks , on the other hand , are shockingly expensive and made with middle of the road spirits if you want something other than beer you should probably head elsewhere",1.0
"my boyfriend and i went here for our date night and i absolutely enjoyed the food we started off with the fried pig ears as a snack the sweet thai chili sauce it was in was delicious and i could not stop eating the pig ears it was garnished with cilantro and thin slices of quick pickled cucumbers the acidity balanced the sweetness of the sauce for our entree , we built our own meat potatoes for two , which includes a 45 oz rib eye and bone marrow gratin everything exceeded our expectations ! we ordered the steak with the house steak sauce , mashed potatoes , and a side of the roasted cauliflower the bone marrow gratin was very rich and flavorful and paired well with the steak we ordered a medium rare rib eye and it was very tender and juicy the house steak sauce was like a combination between a1 and ketchup the roasted cauliflower had a sweet flavor and it was delicious we booked reservations a week before to make sure we could eat here the rib eye with the additional sides ended up being around 120 the food was absolutely delicious that we were happily paying for it",1.0
"i came here with a group of friends and was pleasantly surprised with how delicious the food was ! i ordered the costilla de puerco , which was tender pork ribs in a mole sauce the meat fell right off the bone and the mole sauce was packed with flavor my friends got the quesadillas and fajitas and were happy with their food and portion size too it 's a pretty small place and we made reservations 2 days beforehand to accommodate 7 people we pretty much took half of the seats i will definitely come back whenever i crave for mexican !",1.0

the 'flavored' coffees here really hit the spot super friendly service is always nice the mocha was unfortunately just a cup of weak swiss miss hot chocolate stick with the cappuccino and special flavored coffees here,1.0
excellent french pastries here with the star of the show being the apple turnover perfect balance of flaky crust with non canned apple fruit filling bravo for keeping a warm oven on when they offer to warm up your pastry one too many times have diners cafes used a microwave to heat up pastries and ruin them ! this place knows exactly what they 're doing one small negative was the very friendly guy helping me behind the register was wearing a rather soiled white hat small negative for a wonderful addition to the vegas pastry scene,1.0
"a little hard to find , but i do love the unusual 'asia' flavors like tropical fruits or sesame ice cream portions are generous",1.0

favorite new place in berea food and service is awesome i was skeptical at first because i'm such a picky eater and was n't sure if they offered something i would like my friend ordered the pizza and some chicken fingers he raved about the pizza the garlic sauce for the wings was amazing i ordered a chicken wrap with a side salad which was so delicious the chef charles is great and really puts a lot of attention in preparing the food a must go to place,1.0

"i saw the orange sign the other day while in the area and i thought it was worth checking out i'm a fan of cane 's down the street and the neighborhood can always use another fried chicken place that is n't kfc i would compare the menu to that of popeye 's but you can tell they take a lot more pride in what they are doing i did n't feel like messing with the bone so i ordered a 4 piece chicken strip combo that came with two sides and a roll i ordered the dirty rice and cole slaw as a side just because i did n't want two starches as my sides it only took a few minutes and when they called out my number i was greeted by a steaming order of perfectly battered chicken strips and two decent size sides i 'd bet my life on the roll being fresh from a pack of king 's hawaiian rolls the gentleman preparing my meal was even thoughtful enough to put a side of hot sauce \( like louisiana hot sauce but maybe a touch thinner \) on my tray and asked me if i wanted ranch and bbq well done , i 'll give these guys some credit and i hope it sticks around it 's exactly what i thought it would be when i saw the sign and walked in the door",1.0
"we 've lived in the neighborhood for quite some time and were sad to see slice of sicily close shortly after mamma mia 's in the last couple years we saw the menu for my slice of the pie and were somewhat skeptical given the non traditional combinations and flavors , but i must say i walked away very impressed with the quality of the food and the fresh spin on something you 've eaten your whole life we got a few specialty slices and when they were packaged up and ready to go , randy dropped them off to explain the inspiration behind the items and the backstory behind the toppings it 's great to see a new place in the area that is ran and operated with the passion and energy of something our generation rarely gets to experience a locally owned pizza shop and someone who truly cares about what they are doing keep it up , randy !",1.0
"i think bouchon is one of those places you have to eat at least once while in vegas i know , vegas has mouth watering cuisine at every corner , but there is something special about bouchon the first time i dined at bouchon , i was with 6 other people and we had a reservation for 8 30pm our service was so painfully slow , but my steak frites was so buttery and tender that i forgot it almost took 45 minutes to get served the server also spilled sauce all over my friend 's purse jacket while clearing our plates , but he was very apologetic i revisited a few days ago and had a 6 30pm reservation for 13 people even though eating this early is not appealing for most folks , we had a substantially better experience the service was on point , our drinks were refilled constantly , and our food came out in a timely manner i tried the mussels , and the sauce is to die for i wish i could just sop up all of the sauce with the yummy bread overall , i think bouchon has quality food for very reasonable prices \( 20 45 \) definitely better than any over priced vegas buffet !",1.0
bouchon bakery is a must for me whenever i'm in vegas i love the pistachio macarons and will get one \( and a box \) whenever i am there they are a little bit pricey but worth every nibble i 've tried all of the flavors but pistachio is really the best the bakery is located on the casino level of the venetian underneath a set of escalators,1.0

"original post 12 06 11 updated 03 03 12awesome place , but i could do without the trendier than thou french patrons at a french bakery that 's a joke seriously this place is so legit french people are patrons of the establishment ! ! ! i 've been on and off the strip in search of the best french bakery and it is my opinion that one does not need to look any further than this place their food and baked goods are fabulous and i highly recommend a visit to this bakery since discovering this place , i have encountered stories from people as far away as henderson that know of this bakery and make the 30 minute journey just for patisserie manon my first stop here was because it was close to the house and i was in search of breakfast pastry or two once there i noticed that they also had mini quiches so i purchased two to take home for my wife and all i can say is wow \( taste was great \) since that time , i have had the pleasure of having had and fallen in love with the following menu items from the bakery baguettes crunchy or soft and oh , so light and wonderful viennoiserie my favorite is the pain au chocolatemacarons as they should be with a crisp shell and soft airy goodness inside individual cakes fraisier is my favorite followed by the foret noirfrom the bistro quiches various flavors but my favorite is still the spinach and goat cheese ham or turkey croissantcroq monsieur yum , yum i like a fried egg on top of minethere are more items on the menu that i have yet to get around to sampling , but the ones listed above are what i have tried lets see , what else the place is family owned , the service is great and the people are personable the only con lattes are a bit of a disappointment , it is my understanding that they just have a premix or something like that , which is fine since it is a patisserie and not a cafe they do have regular coffee which is fine also the premixed lattes are n't bad or anything , i like the mocha myself , i would just prefer the ability to order up a fresh made latte or an espresso sometimes after writing this updated review , i now feel the urge to go pay them a visit damn them for being so close to my house",1.0
"this is my second time at snooze and i absolutely love how light the breakfast meals are i ordered the breakfast pot pie and the omg french toast although the pot pie was cream based , the pairing with a light flaky pastry makes the whole portion light and airy the flavoring is just right not too salty the omg french toast was a much smaller portion than expected but it was amazing ! the level of sweetness for the sauce is similar to those of condense milk overall , i enjoyed the both breakfast picks , maybe more so for the french toast since i have a thing for sweet breakfast",1.0

"really cute retro style diner with great food ! came here for sat brunch with a friend , had to wait for some time though because it was pretty busy the waitress was friendly and quick to serve us tried the smoked salmon eggs benny as well as the breakfast special with blueberry pancakes , ham , maple glazed baked beans , challah toast and eggs the pancakes were beyond fluffy and the toast was amazing ! portion size was huge so the pricier order was worth it the coffee was on point as well , came with fresh milk ! would definitely come back",1.0

"i had high expectations for this place and it did not disappoint however , there are some things i was not told about at first and did not expect even though i should 've the line was way longer than expected it almost went out the door ! and moving forward in the line took forever it was a thirty minute wait also , the place is way smaller than it should be i completely missed the store while trying to find it it looked like it was just squished between two buildings i could just assume that they had no choice , but with the amount of sales i saw they were racking in , i had hoped that they would 've moved to a more spacious place by now however , watching the ice cream be made and rolled is really amusing especially when they were rolled up not to mention , the staff looked friendly and gave a lot of smiles also , they have a lot of choices to choose from and it 's s place where family and friends would all enjoy my brother personally recommends the birthday cake flavor they literally put a vanilla cake into their house cream it 's then topped with whipped cream , sprinkles , and animal crackers it make me feel like a kid again i do n't really want to come here again , but it 's a good place to go to and would definitely recommend it to others",1.0
"wow , this place was worth the wait , and by that i mean 12 a m on a saturday morning ! even though i was getting sleepy , the food woke me up right away my favorites were the tofu \( two ways \) , the butter scallop , the enoki mushroom , the sukiyaki \( a special of the night for 40 \) , and the whole fish done two ways \( 30 \) i say favorites but that was pretty much all that the two of us had ! we wanted to try more but were so stuffed next time , we are definitely bringing more people so we can try more things !",1.0
"great spot for dessert lovers we decided on the strawberry and chestnut desserts , along with a dessert wine that paired nicely with the strawberry flavors both were delicious we sat at the bar and had a nice job talking to the chefs and seeing them do their craft the chef said he makes probably around 30 40 of the strawberry desserts a day ! we also took a chocolate croissant to go which was tasty but t i did n't think it was worth the price nice place but i would n't wait too long for this one",1.0
"i 've tried bouchon in la and recommended it to a group of friends during our vegas trip i think it 's decently priced for lunch and a much better alternative to some of the \( relatively \) more popular places to eat for brunch \( ahem mon ami gabi \) i love mussels , and the ones i had in bouchon in la were some of the best i 've had thankfully , the one in vegas remains the same it 's a huge portion size that makes the 25 50 price tag very worth it my trick is to first eat the ones that allow me to dig a little hole and reach the white wine with saffron sauce then i can eat my mussels and dip my french fries into the sauce at the same time ! pure deliciousness \) i tried some of the croque madame and smoked salmon baguette which were both outstanding a friend also ordered the special of the day which was a pork belly blt service was a little slow , but we had a large group and i did n't mind that much i was amazed at how identical the vegas bouchon and la bouchon looked uncanny ! i really think this is the best sunday brunch you 'll find on the strip , granted you 're looking for a french style brunch and not a buffet the prices are probably a little more expensive , but the food is so , so much better !",1.0
"this place was a pleasant surprise i remember going to a restaurant in japan and grinding sesame with the mortar and pestle and this is the same we had the katsu don and the pork cutlet curry with shrimp tempura and i would get both again the cutlet and tempura were both perfectly fried and juicy , and the egg in the katsu don was still slightly runny , which i prefer the salad dressing was tart , balancing it perfectly with all the fried richness i also tried the melon float , which i personally would n't get again because it was a little sweet for me",1.0
"i 've only had the alcoholic ice cream here \( go big in vegas , right \? \) and i 've liked all of them ranging from beers to prosecco to wine , the ice cream is all very flavorful and true to the drink my favorites are the cabernet ice cream and the prosecco a single scoop is 4 but it 's a huge scoop that you can easily share with someone else we also tried the ice cream flight \( 16 \) another time which was not worth the price it 's much better to stick to just one scoop than sample four tiny scoops for much more beware that the line can move very slowly",1.0
"this is a great place to have a relaxing afternoon tea on the strip it is easy to get to \( good location \) , but far enough to escape the vegas chaos i would recommend calling and making a reservation we were n't smart enough to do so , and had to wait around 30 minutes sunday afternoon they had two options for afternoon tea with tasting the classic \( 38 \) and a special holiday edition \( 45 with proceeds benefiting the nevada ballet theater \) both include a pot of tea we went with the classic i had the mandarin orange blend \( the house special \) and the bf had the monkey picked oolong both were really good we are avid tea drinkers \( especially of the chinese variety \) and really impressed by the quality of the tea you can also request milk , sugar , and honey to go with it the food was very good too the tea comes with 10 bite sized snacks 4 appetizers , 2 scones , and 4 desserts my favorites were the curry chicken with asian pear and the scones the desserts were almost too cute to eat ! all in all , one of the best afternoon teas i have had oh , also , if i were to do it again , i would request one of the tables by the window \( floor to ceiling windows \) so that you can have a really nice view while you enjoy",1.0
"craftsteak was an exceptional meal from beginning to end we 've tried craft before in la , but craftsteak is definitely my favorite out of the two service was topnotch and the food was excellent we had the lobster bisque , which was the best one i 've ever had the bisque was so flavorful and fragrant , and had huge chunks of perfectly cooked lobster it 's even poured table side to give a little pizzazz i also had the caesar salad , which tasted great my only complaint would be the whole anchovies served on top of the salad \( it 's weird seeing little slivers of fish sitting on top of your salad , at least to me \) we wanted to try two different preparations of steak , so we had the ny strip \( which is grilled \) and the tbone \( which is roasted \) i'm really glad we chose two extremely different ones because it was the best way to taste the subtle differences in each the ny strip had a really great charred , smokey flavor the tbone has a much softer , buttery texture and is more mild \( less of that heavy meaty taste \) i preferred the ny strip , but the tbone was more interesting and unique for sides we had the potato gratin and the hen of the woods mushroom we had a hard time picking the mushrooms because i wanted to get just one type \( i thought the the assortment was a little too expensive at 24 compared to the 14 for one \) our server explained each and we ended up choosing the hen , which has a smokey , robust flavor both the gratin and mushroom paired perfectly with our steak we skipped dessert because we were too full , but it looked appetizing so i 'd recommend trying to save some room for dessert out of the three steakhouses i 've tried in vegas \( the other two being sw and stripsteak \) , this is hands down my favorite to me , it has the best ambience and dining experience , and most importantly , the best preparation of steak",1.0
our favorite drink that we always get here is the nutella coffee we 've tried so many of them everywhere and this one is the most satisfying it has a super rich coffee flavor and is not overly sweet very reasonable prices too ! p s it is on the strip right outside of monte carlo near the ice cream blvd creamery,1.0
"how can anyone not love this place \? ! it 's open 24 hours to boot ! this was our first stop in vegas per friends' recommendations and it was great ! the sandwiches were fresh , flavorful , and fun to eat ! i was perfectly stuffed after one but some friends bought another and shared i love how the bread is crisped and the meat inside tastes really good my only critique would be that they all start tasting the same after awhile , unless there 's horseradish in there , haha",1.0
this is probably my favorite coffe spots in town while i'm not a coffee connoisseur it has always been fantastic in my humble opinion the baristas are very accommodating and all the varieties of drinks i have tried have been good really love the location and particularly ambiance as well i do wish they did allow dogs as the name kind of seems more dog friendly than the establishment,1.0
my family and i were in las vegas over the 4th of july weekend and decided to try bouchon as i'm a big fan of thomas keller we had such a great experience my husband ordered the steak and he fell in love i had the lamb which was so tender and tasty we have a 10 month old who joined us and the were extreamly accomidating ca n't wait to go again !,1.0
"i 've never had a piece of chicken this big its huge , which to me justifies the price you can have a very filling and delicious meal for a bit over 15 bucks i had the chicken and their special mango soda drink which they make in house the chicken , in case i did n't make it clear , is huge like the size of an infant 's head and it 's sooooo good ! i certainly prefer it to kfc i got the regular salt and pepper flavor but they have a few other flavors seaweed and something hot i highly recommend this place if you 're looking to try a new type of fried chicken or even if you 're just hungry and are looking for food",1.0

"probably out of all the places we ate at on vay cay this was probably one of my favorite destinations right as we pull up the restaurant had a real vintage feel and life to it alongside the metal advertising signs and bottled soda in the general store it also contained a genuine wooden porch , complete with big wooden planks , rocking chairs , and cracker barrel 's \( obviously \) we put our name 's on the list and proceeded to take a look around their store , it was a really interesting range of merchandise from all american apparel \( trust me i felt really patriotic there \) , to toys for the kids , and asu apparel for the college kids we sat down and took a look at the menu , everyone in my group kept telling me how great their chicken dumplings were but i figured everyone was gonna order it so i could always try it from their plates i decided to go with the chicken fried steak \( which came with 3 sides holy crap \) , sided with mashed w brown gravy , mac'n'cheese , and steak fries when the food came out i noticed my chicken fried steak was about 60 of the plate like disgustingly huge the sides were a little on the slim side but then again i had 3 of em a side of cornbread and biscuits gravy were also provided for us the steak was a little overdone in my opinion , do n't get me wrong it had great flavor but it was a little too crispy for my taste the mashed w brown gravy was tasty the mac was pretty solid , but the steak fries were bland had to use quite a bit of ketchup for those however the biscuits were super delicious , really fresh and puffy on the inside with a slight hardened outside , dunked with the white sausage gravy and life was good \) i also had a bite of my buddies chicken dumplings which honestly tasted really close to a home made casserole and the chicken was a bit dry , guess i'm glad i did n't order it \) i guess i missed out on their breakfast menu so i'm definitely going to have to try out their breakfast next time i'm in town",1.0

"i like this location , especially since the renovation it looks amazing the rustic wood theme is really well done and comes together nicely the new seats are comfortable , and the entire space feels larger however , its not a starbucks where you can sit , relax , enjoy your coffee and read a book it 's really busy , and noisy it 's a good place to meet friends and grab a cup to go , as its usually full if you do get lucky and find a seat , its a good place to have a conversation sometimes , the people sitting next you join in on the conversation , i kind of like that it 's a bit north european , where everyone is seated so close to each other that you have cross talk at the same time , when you do want to have a private conversation with someone , it becomes challenging as everyone is seated closely on a positive note , despite the location busy , the washrooms are kept clean thats one thing i like about starbucks , you an expect a clean washroom in most of their stores",1.0
"this is a really clean food basic 's the prices are good , there 's always a sale they do charge for bags , so bring reusable bags with you the staff , particularly the cashiers , can sometimes come off as rude but the prices make up for it this location is a particularly busy , it makes getting in and out quick and easy they take american express \( amex \) and apple pay",1.0
"i like the taste of starbucks coffee , but i hate the high prices hence , why i only get starbucks if i have too , or if i fell like i need a change this location is busy during the day the location is small , and the seating is extremely limited you sometimes feel like your having conversations with people at the other tables , because its so cramped other than the cramped quarters , its your typical starbucks great tasting products , high prices",1.0

"this is my go to location when i'm in school and i feel like i need a pick me upper , but want something other than a regular cup of coffee starbucks offer great choices , and allows you customize your beverages for instance you can request your caramel macchiato to be made with lactose free milk , california style , no whip cream \( my favourite by the way \) this location is busy during regular school hours they do , however , do a good job of clearing the line quickly one thing i ca n't stress enough , is how much i hate their pricing , starbucks is extremely overpriced , despite the quality and taste that 's why i go to starbucks when i feel like i need a change , or feel like a treat note the seating is limited at this location , i 've never been able to find seating during the day",1.0
"its a great location , that is convenient to get to for the size of the store it has plenty of seating indoors and a few outdoor seats as well there are many bar type seats in the middle of the store and along the windows in the front the location is clean and the service is good the staff were super helpful in making recommendations for tea the location has wi fi but connecting to it took a bit of waiting",1.0
i had lunch here yesterday the staff were really friendly and accomodating i was a first timer everyone else that came in were regulars and all agreed anything off the menu was amazing i got the pulled pork pie which i ate immediately and a steak and cheese to heat up at work later for dinner the pastry is so good and the flavor of each pie very delicious i was expecting to be fumbling with a knife and fork while driving but was very impressed with the packaging that allowed me to eat it like a burger one handed awesome !,1.0

"i drive for miles to get me a pulled pork sandwich from grill time i used to work in the area a few years ago and would make a point of going here for lunch regularly any sandwich with hot meat inside is a go for me and they have a great selection there are usually a few tables to sit at if you 'd like to eat in they will cook anything in the fridge for you fresh and in your face at the bar style seating around their grilling station i 've had the tenderloin steak and it was boss on top of all the food they will cook for you , there is a plethera of things to take home and grill up yourself and all the fixings to make it just the way you like it a wall of spices , seasonings , and sauces all locally sourced and charcoal if thats your thing im trying an organic coconut husk charcoal the owner recomended home town feel and big time taste ! i 'll be back again and again",1.0

"my wife and i were looking for a place to eat and came across winghart 's we went to the upstairs area and sat at a table near the bar the place was slightly noisy and there 's a jukebox but the music was at the perfect volume i ordered the necessity with onions instead of jalape os i'm a fan of spicy food about as much as pirates fans enjoy seeing the cardinals win the burger was tasty but i was n't a fan of the bbq honey mustard combo the fries were well seasoned but a tad salty my wife got the funnel cake as natives of new jersey , we are used to funnel cakes from the jersey shore \( hold the snooki \) the funnel cake was delicious the service was great and i would recommend this place",1.0
"we were intrigued by this fairly new ice cream establishment and elected to give it a try it 's similar to coldstone when you walk in , you give your choice of about a dozen store created mixes or a build your own option i choice the coffee with a blend of real blueberries and oreos after you order it , another employee mixes and mashes your combo into several small ice cream wraps it reminds me of the days when i used to eat fruit roll ups as a kid then , another employee puts your choice of toppings on the finished cup it 's a pretty interesting idea , but when the place is packed you can barely hear your name being called there 's also a lot of loud banging by the employees in making each person 's concoctions that was slightly annoying the employees all had a smile on their face and i would recommend to others",1.0
"well per usual anthony 's did not disappoint tried to book a table with my folks' favorite server fabio but he was off that evening regardless our server was attentive and cordial we were there to celebrate my parents' 60th anniversary no small feat 60 years and no one got killed i made sure that i mentioned that when confirming our reservation \( the anniversary not the killing part \) which is where this overall glowing review gets a little tarnished you see after our splendid meal \( where 's the tartare and carpaccio btw \? \) our server presented chocolate covered strawberries with one of those printed chocolate anniversary disks normally a charming gesture with very chilled berries and adequate chocolate and a wee drizzle of chocolate sauce nice treat pleasant surprise the catch \? they were added to the check we were charged for the cold strawberries with hard , tasteless chocolate coating that was disappointing because if we were going to pay for dessert surely one of the pastry chef 's creations would 've outshone this option otherwise a fine fine dining experience at anthony 's as always !",1.0
"my only warning they 're closed on mondays the atmosphere is terrific the repurposed boards on the walls , the crazy light fixture over the communal dining table , even the egg crates on the ceiling are all terrific i ordered a bacon avocado burger an absolutely loved it even the fries were terrific my friend ordered the croque madame \( madame because it comes with an egg \) and while he did n't share , he did say it was terrific as well looking forward to finding an excuse to go back for breakfast sometime soon",1.0

"i wonder if , given a decade or so , we 'll look back at this period of rustic architecture and re purposing of buildings the way we do avocado green appliances , shag carpeting and fuzzy wall paper regardless , for today and tomorrow , the atmosphere , service and food at windsor was terrific i loved every minute of my time there hell , even the bathrooms \( uni sex and shared with next door 's churn were pleasing \) ! and i love the cassette tape wall if you 're anti hipster , this is not the place for you if you dig tasty and cool , stop by soon we arrived around 9 30 am on sunday and the main restaurant held a 15 minute wait , we could have been seated at the bar , but even though it was already a hot morning , seeing a couple groups of young women seating on the patio , we discerned that it could n't be to bad out there we were right ! fans and misters made it very nice to eat on the patio i recommend it my daughter ordered the highroad sandwich , my gf went with the crab cakes benedict , and i opted for the matador everyone loved their selections and shared them around the table a side of biscuits and gravy was ordered also , and it was full of big chunks of awesome , local sausage so if you like chili verde , go with the matador great take on huevos rancheros , served over windsor 's griddled cheddar potatoes my only issue was that the tortilla was pretty stiff and difficult to cut , but the flavors were terrific the hollandaise on the benedict was a little cheesy for my tastes , but good and freshly made in fact , our server \( alex \) informed us that pretty much everything on the menu was made fresh on site and locally sourced both big issues in my book , and thankfully becoming the norm in the new restaurant revolution unfortunately , price follows the revolution , but in the case of the windsor , it was worth it i 'll be back to sample the lunch dinner menu hope to see you there",1.0

"got my christmas tamales here , first time ordering , not the last ! sampled many types , all were good , all had their own merrits everyone 's favorite was the green chili chicken tamales , for me a close second were the chicken mole followed by the green chili pork and the poblana chilis and monterey jack my biggest complaint about most tamales is the excruciating lack of filling , but not from the tamale store ! these are big tamales with big filling trust me and get your tamales here",1.0
"i saw a review that likened gadzooks to chipotle as i made it through the line and their staff assembled my lunch , i can see how that comparison can be made in process alone i love that they have limited items on the menu \( basically , enchilada , taco , tortilla soup \) but then there 's an option explosion for what you put in them i had a green chili pork enchilada and a bison enchilada both were terrific it was the best bison i 've ever had , in fact the house smashed guacamole was delicious also i thought i was smart by getting there at 11 30 \( avoiding the noon rush \) but they were already very busy i got the last parking space and the next to last interior table thankfully the tables seemed to turn quickly and the line moved in the same way there are misters on the patio if that 's your only course of action i will certainly come back and i 'll bring friends",1.0
i figured the wait on a sunday would be long and it was 25 30 minutes turned into an hour for a table in the restaurant not a high top at the bar server was just ok never checked on us once to refill drinks until we were ready to leave probably because we did n't order beer wings were excellent we ordered dry rub with 2 sides of sauce hubby 's burger \( thick rick \) and fries were delicious enough for 3 people ! stay away from the bay of pigs cuban pork sandwich it was nothing like the sandwich described by the pd food editor unless you like 80 fat and gristle it was gross i 'd definitely come back but stick with a burger or chicken sandwich,0.0

the berry bowls here are really refreshing we got samples of the bowls we wanted to try and the staff was really nice and helpful they made suggestions for what they liked and we had a fun conversation while we were ordering food i got the raspberry sauce bowl it was soft serve consistency acai mix that was super light and it had granola mix and fruit toppings and a raspberry sauce drizzled over it i usually like thicker bowls with frozen banana and protein powder mixed in but this is a good place for light refreshing bowls and you can get add ins like protein powder mixed in if you want i heard about this place a while ago and wanted to try it glad i finally did and they the bowls were so good i really liked that they had samples and that the staff really loved the bowls they were making and had tried most everything on the menu they have indoor and outdoor seating and it 's good on a hot day,1.0

"first time there and i was impressed their beer selection is amazing with what must have been a list with over 100 different selections from all over the world best part of that is that their own brews \( 15 \) are always on tap and ready for sampling their menu is better than you 'd expect for a small , local brewery our group tried the hummus , perogis , cyclops burger and a few of the beers i was so full afterwards that we decided to walk the three blocks to get ice cream instead of moving the car to make some room bbe is a great place to bring out of town guests to get a true taste of cleveland brewing",1.0

very tasty shawarmas this used to be my number one favorite shawarma joint for a number of years probably one the best in terms of traditional more authentic shawarmas service can be slow especially around the dinner rush if you are short on time and there is a long line ordering on the rocks will expedite the process waiting for a shawarma especially when you are in a hurry can feel like you 've been waiting forever,1.0
i always enjoy trying new shawarmas and seeing how they stack up against the greats i came across pita land and did n't expect too much but gave it a try wow ! their chicken shawarma was the most delicious and juicy chicken i have ever tried somehow they pack the chicken with the best most mouth watering flavor i 've had i used to swear by lazeez but after trying pita land there is a new clear favorite 10 10 would recommend any shawarma enthusiast try one out a few tasty extras that they offer that are out of the norm are jalape os which can bring a unique flavor to the wrap the only area i would like them to improve upon is mixing the ingredients in tge wrap more,1.0

"we went to las vegas strictly to see a show that we had wanted to see for a couple of years we were looking for a non gaming hotel and were undecided between the four seasons and mandarin oriental the four seasons provided everything we expected beautiful hotel , very quiet , superb customer service , quality rooms with comfortable bedding , many nice amenities in the room , excellent housekeeping service , three express elevators and delicious food in the verandah restaurant we reserved a basic room , which is what we received the lowest floor \( 35th \) overlooking the airport runway and the mandalay bay convention center parking lot it was n't the best view and you could hear the planes taking off but since we were only staying two nights it was fine we really liked being able to schedule the three hour window that would work best in our schedule for housekeeping to clean our room we enjoyed the proximity to mandalay bay , as we went there a couple of times and it was great to return to the serenity of the four seasons via the secret door i am glad we selected this hotel and would highly recommend it",1.0

"this is a beautiful resort is full of exceptional attention to even the smallest of details the rooms and prado restaurant have beautiful tuscan decor and the roq and other areas of the resort have a southwest mexican feel it is very well done the staff is outstanding , yet inobtrusive the rooms are beautiful combining old and new they have gorgeous bathrooms and nice patios balconies the bed is so wonderful that it is hard to get out of it my one and only complaint is the mandatory resort fee which supposedly includes parking , complimentary wireless internet and access to the joya spa we were led to believe that this fee was optional and you could decline it but that was not the case we were there one day , did not use the internet , parking or spa also , we ate two meals in prado , whereas many other guests brought pizza and subs , along with beer and wine , to their rooms and others went to other restaurants in the area i feel if you eat in the restaurants and drink in the resort 's bars the resort fee should be waived or be included in the daily rate since supposedly all guests have to pay it we are frequent intercontinental hotel guests in different cities and have never experienced this add on fee i personally found it insulting and will take this into consideration in the future and stay at a resort that does not have such a fee",1.0
